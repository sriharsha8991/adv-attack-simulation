## Blackhat Hacker AI Agent – Part 1 (Threat Profile/ Attack Scenario Generation) 

 

#### Project Overview and Intent 

The objective of this project is to design and build an AI-driven adversary simulation agent that can generate realistic cyberattack scenarios based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and real-world threat intelligence. This agent is intended to simulate the behavior of skilled black-hat attackers and advanced persistent threats in a controlled and auditable manner. The generated attacks will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls such as EDR, SIEM, WAF, IDS/IPS, Active Directory, cloud security platforms, and identity systems. 

The AI agent will never directly execute attacks. Its sole responsibility is to generate attack scenarios, referred to as abilities, and submit them to the platform in a structured JSON format. Each generated ability must be reviewed and approved by a human operator before it can be executed. This human-in-the-loop mechanism is mandatory and non-negotiable, ensuring safety, compliance, and operational control at all times. 

 

#### Scope of the MVP 

The scope of the first week is to deliver a working minimum viable product that demonstrates the full lifecycle of AI-generated attack creation, review, and readiness for execution. By the end of the week, the AI agent must be capable of analyzing MITRE ATT&CK data, enriching attack logic with threat intelligence, generating realistic attack abilities across multiple security domains, enforcing human approval gates, and delivering validated JSON payloads to the internal platform API. 

The focus during this week is not breadth alone, but correctness, realism, and safety. All generated attacks must resemble real-world attacker techniques while remaining simulation-safe and reversible. 

 

#### Design Philosophy and Safety Model 

The design of the AI agent is driven by a safety-first philosophy. The agent is treated as an intelligent generator, not an autonomous attacker. It reasons about attacker tradecraft using MITRE ATT&CK and threat intelligence, but it does not make decisions to execute attacks. All attack execution decisions remain under human control. 

Every generated ability must explicitly declare its intent, its MITRE mapping, its execution method, and its expected detection behavior. The system must enforce that no ability can be executed unless its human approval status is explicitly set to APPROVED. Any ability in a PENDING or REJECTED state must be blocked from execution by design, with no override mechanisms. 

 

#### Attack Coverage and Evaluation Domains 

During Week 1, the AI agent is expected to generate attacks across a broad range of security evaluation domains. These include endpoint detection and response evaluations where techniques such as credential dumping, living-off-the-land binaries, memory abuse, and defense evasion are simulated. The agent must also generate attacks designed to test SIEM capabilities by simulating log evasion, delayed multi-stage attacks, and correlation bypass techniques. 

Web application security is another critical domain, where the agent must generate WAF-focused attacks such as injection simulations, payload obfuscation, and API misuse scenarios. Network-level defenses such as IDS and IPS must be evaluated through command-and-control beacon simulations, encrypted traffic anomalies, and DNS-based signaling techniques. 

Active Directory security testing must include credential access simulations, lateral movement techniques, directory abuse scenarios, and privilege escalation paths commonly used by attackers. Beyond AD, the agent must also cover persistence techniques, privilege escalation methods, lateral movement strategies, and defense evasion techniques that are commonly observed in real intrusions. 

Cloud and identity security evaluations are also within scope. The agent must generate attack abilities that simulate IAM misconfigurations, token abuse, metadata service exploitation, and identity privilege escalation. Finally, controlled data exfiltration simulations must be included, using non-destructive dummy data and clearly marked simulation flags. 

 

#### Ability Structure and Output Requirements 

 

Each attack generated by the AI agent is represented as an ability. An ability is a complete, self-contained description of an attack scenario. It includes a unique identifier, a clear name, a detailed description of the attack’s purpose, and its classification into a specific attack category. 

Every ability must include a precise mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, identifying the tactic, technique, and sub-technique it represents. Threat intelligence context must be included to explain how and why this technique is used in real-world attacks. Each ability must define one or more executors, representing different execution methods an attacker might use, such as PowerShell, command prompt, Bash, or scripting languages. These executors must include realistic commands, operating system context, and privilege requirements. 

All abilities must be created with a human approval status set to PENDING and a status indicating that the ability was created by the AI. The platform must treat these fields as mandatory gates, and execution must be impossible until approval is granted. 

The AI agent must output abilities strictly in JSON format. No explanatory text, comments, or markdown formatting is allowed in the output sent to the API. 

 

#### Development Plan 

The first day of development focuses on architecture and data modeling. During this phase, the overall AI agent workflow is defined, including how MITRE ATT&CK data is consumed, how threat intelligence is incorporated, and how attack abilities are generated and validated. The JSON schema for abilities is finalized and versioned, and approval states are formally defined. This day establishes the foundation on which all subsequent work depends. 

 

On the second day, development shifts to the MITRE and threat intelligence reasoning layer. The agent is taught how to understand MITRE tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques, and how to associate them with appropriate attack categories. Threat intelligence enrichment is added so that generated attacks reflect real attacker behavior rather than theoretical examples. By the end of this day, the agent should be able to explain the rationale behind each attack it generates. 

The third day is dedicated to building the ability generation engine. This component is responsible for creating realistic attack abilities with multiple execution paths. The agent must select appropriate executors based on operating system and context, generate plausible attacker commands, and ensure that all abilities default to a pending approval state. The focus here is on realism, diversity, and correctness of execution logic. 

On the fourth day, the focus expands to attack coverage. The agent is extended to generate abilities across all defined attack categories, including persistence, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and defense evasion. Variants of the same attack technique are generated using different execution methods to avoid static patterns. Risk levels are assigned to each ability based on impact and detectability. 

The fifth day is dedicated to safety controls and approval enforcement. Hard validation rules are implemented to ensure that no ability can be executed without explicit human approval. Simulation-only flags and reversible execution markers are added, and audit-related metadata is incorporated. This day ensures that safety and governance requirements are technically enforced rather than relying on policy alone. 

On the sixth day, the AI agent is integrated with the internal platform API. The focus here is on ensuring clean JSON output, handling batch submissions, validating payloads, and implementing retry and error-handling logic. By the end of this day, the agent must be able to reliably submit abilities to the platform in a production-ready format. 

The seventh and final day of the week is reserved for review, testing, and demonstration. The agent generates abilities across all supported categories, approval gating is verified, and MITRE mappings are validated. An internal demo is conducted to show the end-to-end flow from AI-generated attack to human approval and execution readiness. Gaps are identified, and a roadmap for the next phase of development is prepared. 

 

#### Success Criteria 

The project will be considered successful if the AI agent consistently generates realistic, MITRE-mapped attack abilities, enforces human approval without exception, produces clean and validated JSON output, and supports meaningful evaluation of security controls. The system must be safe, auditable, and aligned with real-world attacker behavior.  
 
Expected Outcome: 
AI Agent will send the attack scenarios to existing APIs for human approval.
